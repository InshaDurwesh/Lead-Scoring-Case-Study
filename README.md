# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
This project aims to enhance the lead conversion rate for X Education, an online course provider, which currently stands at approximately 30%. By developing a logistic regression model, the project identifies 'Hot Leads'—prospective customers most likely to convert—by assigning lead scores based on key attributes such as Lead Source and Total Time Spent on Website. The objective is to improve targeted communication and optimize resource allocation, ultimately increasing the conversion rate to around 80%. The findings and model can be adapted to changing business needs, facilitating more effective sales strategies moving forward.
